# Web-scraping-triggers
This repository contains a Python script for web scraping economic indicators from www.tradingeconomics.com, specifically for the United States. The script uses Selenium and Beautiful Soup for scraping, tkinter for creating a message box, and openpyxl for editing the XLSX file. The script also uses other libraries as pyautogui. Once the data is scraped, it's stored in an excel sheet. This project can be useful for automating data collection and entry for financial analysis or research. Please open an issue if you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvement.
